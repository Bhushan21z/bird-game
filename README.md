# bird-game
This is a javascript bird game.
------------------------- GAME DESCRIPTION --------------------------------------
I made this game using HTML Css and JavaScript.

I used css animation function to move walls from right to left randomly.
Bird keep falling down few height after every mili-seconds and we use space key to keep him floating in air. For this I used set-interval function of javascript.
For keeping track of bird is moving smoothly without getting hit by walls I maintain few variables storing bird x and y coordinates on the present screen and also for every walls as well.
When any walls (x,y) coordinate meet with birds (x,y) coordinate then game gets over. For storing score i used score variable in java script and keep in running until game gets over.


-------------------------- RULES ----------------------------------------------------
TRY NOT TO HIT BY ANY WALL.
Use SPACE key to keep floating in air 
Use W key to get big jump up
Use S key to get big fall down


HOPE YOU ALL LIKE THIS GAME.
